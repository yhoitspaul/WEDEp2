    <H1>Evolution of Audi</H1>

    <p>
    Audi started in 1909 when August Horch built small cars that were known for good engineering. After many changes and a big merger, the brand became part of Volkswagen and introduced the famous “quattro” all‑wheel‑drive with the 1980 Audi Quattro rally car. From there the company moved to the modern Audi A4 sedan in the 1990s, which set the style for today’s sleek, tech‑filled models, and now Audi makes electric cars that keep the same focus on performance and design.
